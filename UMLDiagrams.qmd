# **Unified Modeling Language (UML) Diagrams**

Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a general-purpose modeling language. The main aim of UML is to define a standard way to visualize the way a system has been designed. It is quite similar to blueprints used in other fields of engineering. UML is not a programming language, it is rather a visual language.

-   We use UML diagrams to show thebehavior and structure of a system.

-   UML helps software engineers, businessmen, and system architects with modeling, design, and analysis.

## **Why do we need UML?**

-   Complex applications need collaboration and planning from multiple teams and hence require a clear and concise way to communicate amongst them.
-   Businessmen do not understand code. So UML becomes essential to communicate with non programmers about essential requirements, functionalities, and processes of the system.
-   A lot of time is saved down the line when teams can visualize processes, user interactions, and the static structure of the system.

## **Types of UML Diagrams**

UML is linked with object-oriented design and analysis. UML makes use of elements and forms associations between them to form diagrams. Diagrams in UML can be broadly classified as:

# **UML Class Diagram**

A [**UML**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design/unified-modeling-language-uml-introduction/) class diagram visually represents the structure of a system by showing its classes, attributes, methods, and the relationships between them.

1.  Helps everyone involved in a project—like developers and designers—understand how the system is organized and how its components interact.

2.  Helps to communicate and document the structure of the software.
