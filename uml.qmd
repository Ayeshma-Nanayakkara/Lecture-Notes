# **Unified Modeling Language (UML) Diagrams**

Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a general purpose visual modeling language. The main aim of UML is to define a standard way to visualize the way a system has been designed.

-   We use UML diagrams to show the behavior and structure of a system.

-   UML helps software engineers, businessmen, and system architects with modeling, design, and analysis.

# **Why do we need UML?**

-   Complex applications need collaboration and planning from multiple teams and hence require a clear and concise way to communicate amongst them.

-   Businessmen do not understand code. So UML becomes essential to communicate with non programmers about essential requirements, functionalities, and processes of the system.

-   A lot of time is saved down the line when teams can visualize processes, user interactions, and the static structure of the system.

## **Types of UML Diagrams**

UML is linked with object-oriented design and analysis. UML makes use of elements and forms associations between them to form diagrams. Diagrams in UML can be broadly classified as:
